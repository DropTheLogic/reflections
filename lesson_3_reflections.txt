<When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?>
It could be useful when working with others so that they could immediately get to working
on them. Also if a small file needed to be added to an otherwise complete piece of work.

<Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up to date with your remote repository?>
It could be that you aren't ready to share the change you are working on, especially when colaborating.
It could also be like commits, where you decide when a completed piece of work is done.

<Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When do you use one instead of another?>
Branches are simply the path of commits in a repository. A clone copies an entire repository, including any branches.
A fork is a clone that happens on entirely on GitHub's servers. A new branch would occur when you want
to ingtroduce a new feature or direction for a project. A clone would happen if you wanted to move
an entire repository somewhere or between people. And a fork would happen on GitHub if you wanted to
collabororate, contribute, or share a repository on GitHub.

<What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?>
When collaborating with others, it is useful to know when people are working on other features or
are making new commits. Having the most recent state of the project locally helps keep track of where
others are while you are working.
