<When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?>
It could be useful when working with others so that they could immediately get to working
on them. Also if a small file needed to be added to an otherwise complete piece of work.

<Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up to date with your remote repository?>
It could be that you aren't ready to share the change you are working on, especially when colaborating.
It could also be like commits, where you decide when a completed piece of work is done.
