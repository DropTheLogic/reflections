<What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?>
Git creates a .git folder used to store git files and actions. It's necessary to sync files with git

<How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?>
The staging area helps include only the files necessary to include in a commit, as opposed to
the entire working directory.

<How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?>
By using git diff --staged it is possible to recall what exact changes were made
between the working directory files and the most recently commited files.
It can be obvious what changes were made and if they constitute a logical change.

<What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized?
How would branches help?>
Branches are useful when an your project needs to take a new direction,
like adding a new language or a new experimental feature.
Using branches helps to organize your commits in case a new feature didn't work out how you wanted.

<How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?>
They help see where your current commit is relative to the rest of the project. It could get
confusing quickly if there are mulitple branches. Diagrams help see the reachability of commits.
